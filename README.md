Ubuntu Bootstrap
=============

This is a repository used to make the process of setting up a new
install of Ubuntu as simple as possible.

It will do the following:
- Install a number of applications through `apt`/`snap` commands
- Configures [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) with good default preferences and custom CSS. Assumes that the user will want to use Tree Style Tabs.
- Sets up multiple programming language environments, including `pyenv`, `rbenv`, and `nvm`.

Not thoroughly tested - more of a wiki than a true script
at this time.
